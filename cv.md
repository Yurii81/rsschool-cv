### About myself:
I want to learn how to program. Computers and programs have always attracted me. I am quite a strong perfectionist and always bring my affairs to a logical conclusion, I learn quickly enough. At first about a year and a half I worked for a company selling and servicing computer equipment and software. After that I worked in a car repair and maintenance center. I worked like this for about 10 years because I really like working with cars. Then I moved to another city and now I work as an engineer at a large factory for the manufacture of metal structures for the oil and gas industry and shipbuilding.
